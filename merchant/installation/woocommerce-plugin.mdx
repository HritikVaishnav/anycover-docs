## Hiding Anycover products from Wordpress search
To hide Anycover products from Wordpress search as well, go to the **Theme File Editor** in the **Tools section** and add the following code snippet to the bottom of the file:

```php
    //CUSTOM_SNIPPET
    // MAKE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR FILE BEFORE ADDING THIS CODE SNIPPET

    add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'hide_products_from_search' );
    function hide_products_from_search( $query ) {
        if ( ! is_admin() && $query->is_search() && $query->is_main_query() ) {
            $exclude_ids = array(); // create an empty array to store the IDs of the products to be excluded
            $exclude_word = 'exclude me'; // replace with the word to be excluded from the search results

            // get an array of all the products matching the search query
            $args = array(
                'post_type' => 'product',
                's' => get_search_query(),
                'posts_per_page' => -1,
                'fields' => 'ids',
            );
            $product_ids = get_posts( $args );

            // loop through the product IDs and check if the title contains the exclude word
            foreach ( $product_ids as $product_id ) {
                $product_title = get_the_title( $product_id );
                if ( strpos( $product_title, $exclude_word ) !== false ) {
                    $exclude_ids[] = $product_id; // add the product ID to the exclude array
                }
            }

            // set the 'post__not_in' parameter to exclude the products matching the exclude pattern
            if ( ! empty( $exclude_ids ) ) {
                $query->set( 'post__not_in', $exclude_ids );
            }
        }
