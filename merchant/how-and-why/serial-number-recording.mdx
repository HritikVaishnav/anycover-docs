## The what and why
A serial number is a unique identifier provided by the manufacturer to identify their products for inventory 
management and warranty control. The serial number is usually printed on the label on the side or back of 
the product. In some cases, the serial number may also be the unit's barcode. 

If you are uncertain, we recommend checking the manufacturer’s website for information on finding the 
serial number. When in doubt, we recommend noting down all relevant numbers that you think act as serial 
numbers. 

Serial numbers help in warranty control and to minimize the fraudulent claims associated with consumers 
submitting parallel imports, fake or old products for claims. Reducing loss rates thereby helps the extended 
warranty program to remain economically viable for all stakeholders including consumers, merchants and 
insurers.
